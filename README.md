Support of language injection for Textmate bundles

## Task
Implement automatic injection of TextMate bundles to some places in default language in IDEA CE. Typical example would be automatic injection of SQL TextMate bundles to the SQL string in Java. The goal is to make an identification and injection of the already existing engine. Benefit for the student: he will get familiar with the language support API on the way. Also, the plugin should become popular if it is done right.
